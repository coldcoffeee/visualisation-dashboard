# visualisation-dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that I developed as an assignment for an internship. The project leverages a full-stack architecture to retrieve data from a backend server and employs the powerful D3.js library for data visualization.
